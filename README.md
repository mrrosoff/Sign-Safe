# Sign Safe

### An E-Contract Solution For A Modern World

## About Project

A simple to use, secure contract solution built on the Ethereum blockchain. Read our research paper [here](./A_Document_Contract_Solution_For_A_Modern_World.pdf)
and check out our live site [here](https://www.signsafe.technology) (While live, our Backend has been taken down because we are poor). This site uses the security
and immutability of the blockchain to provide a secure contract experience. Users of the site must exchange their names, emails, and Ethereum addresses to 
begin the contract creation. The contract creator can input these fields to initialize the signing process. The signers 
of the document can at that point securely sign the contract hosted on the EVM.

## Installation

To install all packages and run, use the following command. This will spin up a netlify-dev server that will proxy 
lambda requests for expedited development. In addition, it handles webpack-dev-server, and will reload dynamically for 
rapid development.

```bash
npm install && npm install netlify-cli -g && npm start
```
